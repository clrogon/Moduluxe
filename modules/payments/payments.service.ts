 *
 * In a real application, this file would contain functions like:
 *
 * import { Payment } from '../../shared/types';
 *
 * export const getPayments = async (): Promise<Payment[]> => {
 *   const response = await fetch('/api/payments');
 *   if (!response.ok) {
 *     throw new Error('Failed to fetch payments');
 *   }
 *   return response.json();
 * };
